,"""It took me three weeks to stuff the turkey. I stuffed it through the beak."""
,"""If you think about a Thanksgiving dinner, it’s really like making a large chicken."""
,"""Here I am, 5 o’clock in the morning, stuffing bread crumbs up a dead bird’s butt."""
,"""Thanksgiving just gets me all warm and tingly and all kinds of the wonderful inside."""
,"""Thanksgiving creates abundance."""
,"""Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go baste the turkey and hide the kitchen knives."""
,"""Coexistence: what the farmer does with the turkey — until Thanksgiving."""
,"""Overeating at Thanksgiving is a case in point. It’s a national tradition."""
,"""Family gathers to share good noise and good food. Gratitude abounds."""
,"""Thanksgiving is the holiday that encompasses all others. All of them, from Martin Luther King Day to Arbor Day to Christmas to Valentine’s Day, are in one way or another about being thankful."""
,"""Real ballplayers pass the stuffing by rolling it up in a ball and batting it across the table with a turkey leg."""
,"""It’s not too much food. This is what we’ve been training for our whole lives. This is our destiny, this is our finest hour."""
,"""As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them."""
,"""Once you start practicing being grateful and thankful for things, people, and events, you may notice that you start to attract more positive things, people, and events in your life."""
,"""Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is."""
,"""He who thanks but with the lips Thanks but in part; The full, the true Thanksgiving Comes from the heart."""
,"""Turkey for the girls and Turkey for the boys. My favorite kind of pants is corduroys. Gobble gobble goo and Gobble gobble gickel. I wish turkey only cost a nickel. Oh, I love turkey on Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving everybody!"""
,"""My most memorable meal is every Thanksgiving. I love the food: the turkey and stuffing; the sweet potatoes and rice, which come from my mother’s Southern heritage; the mashed potatoes, which come from my wife’s Midwestern roots; the Campbell’s green-bean casserole; and of course, pumpkin pie."""
,"""It has been an unchallengeable American doctrine that cranberry sauce, a pink goo with overtones of sugared tomatoes, is a delectable necessity of the Thanksgiving board and that turkey is uneatable without it."""

,"""When asked if my cup is half-full or half-empty my only response is that I am thankful I have a cup."""

,"""The more we express thanks, the more gratitude we feel. The more gratitude we feel, the more we express thanks. It’s circular, and it leads to a happier life."""

,"""We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures."""
,"""Thanksgiving was nothing more than a pilgrim-created obstacle in the way of Christmas; a dead bird in the street that forced a brief detour."""
,"""Thanksgiving – fall’s finale. Best damn holiday of the year in my worldly estimation."""
,"""Thanksgiving is America’s favorite holiday because it’s a time when we put aside our cares, much as the struggling Pilgrims did nearly four centuries ago, and eat a gut-busting meal without worrying about the ‘out years.’"""
,"""Stand up, on this Thanksgiving Day, stand upon your feet. Believe in man. Soberly and with clear eyes, believe in your own time and place. There is not, and there never has been a better time or a better place to live in."""
,"""I celebrated Thanksgiving in an old-fashioned way. I invited everyone in my neighborhood to my house, we had an enormous feast, and then I killed them and took their land."""
,"""If you stand in the meat section at the grocery store long enough, you start to get mad at turkeys. There’s turkey ham, turkey bologna, turkey pastrami. Someone needs to tell the turkey, man, just be yourself."""
,"""I think that is a better thing than thanksgiving: thanks-living. How is this to be done? By a general cheerfulness of manner, by an obedience to the command of Him by whose mercy we live, by a perpetual, constant delighting of ourselves in the Lord, and by a submission of our desires to His will."""
,"""The funny thing about Thanksgiving, or any big meal, is that you spend 12 hours shopping for it then go home and cook,chop,braise and blanch. Then it’s gone in 20 minutes and everybody lies around sort of in a sugar coma and then it takes 4 hours to clean it up."""
,"""Thanksgiving is the holiday of peace, the celebration of work and the simple life… a true folk-festival that speaks the poetry of the turn of the seasons, the beauty of seedtime and harvest, the ripe product of the year — and the deep, deep connection of all these things with God."""
,"""I always think it’s funny when Indians celebrate Thanksgiving. I mean, sure, the Indians and Pilgrims were best friends during the first Thanksgiving, but a few years later, the Pilgrims were shooting Indians. So, I’m never quite sure why we eat Turkey like everybody else."""
,"""Let us remember that, as much has been given us, much will be expected from us, and that true homage comes from the heart as well as from the lips and shows itself in deeds."""
,"""America has developed a pie tradition unequivocally and unapologetically at the sweet end of the scale, and at no time is this better demonstrated than at Thanksgiving."""
,"""Thanksgiving is one of my favorite days of the year because it reminds us to give thanks and to count our blessings. Suddenly, so many things become so little when we realize how blessed and lucky, we are."""
,"""About 94 percent of Americans prepare and serve turkey at home and most people stick to a traditional menu for the main meal: turkey with cranberry sauce, mashed white potatoes with giblet gravy, candied sweet potatoes topped with marshmallows, a cooked green vegetable dish, relishes, and a pumpkin pie with whipped cream for dessert."""
,"""Every Thanksgiving, we all write down three things we’re thankful for and put them in a hat. Then we pass the hat around the dinner table and everyone has to guess who wrote what!"""
,"""The next day, eating a turkey sandwich with salt and mayonnaise, Rebecca decided Thanksgiving was the best holiday, although she had little to choose from: her family never celebrated Hanukkah but her father was militant about ignoring Christmas and insisted they spend December 25 eating Chinese takeout and going to the movies."""
,"""Almighty God, who hast given us this good land for our heritage; We humbly beseech Thee that we may always prove ourselves a people mindful of Thy favor and glad to do Thy will."""
,"""In November, people are good to each other. They carry pies to each other’s homes and talk by crackling woodstoves, sipping mellow cider. They travel very far on a special November day just to share a meal with one another and to give thanks for their many blessings – for the food on their tables and the babies in their arms."""
,"""Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow."""
,"""We all can ‘act’ a certain way for a brief period of time, for instance, on Thanksgiving, who of us hasn’t had to ‘act’ like we just loved everyone at the table? This brief show of good behavior is not true character. Our character is who we are when no one is looking."""
,"""All across America, we gather this week with the people we love to give thanks to God for the blessings in our lives."""
,"""Pride slays thanksgiving, but a humble mind is a soil out of which thanks naturally grow. A proud man is seldom a grateful man, for he never thinks he gets as much as he deserves."""
,"""Although Thanksgiving comes but once a year, every day should be a day of Thanks. Among all the challenges that we face as people with hearing loss, there are certainly brighter moments in every day – moments that deserve to be recorded in our Gratitude Journal."""
,"""Remember God’s bounty in the year. String the pearls of His favor. Hide the dark parts, except so far as they are breaking out in the light! Give this one day to thanks, to joy, to gratitude!"""
,"""There is one day that is ours. There is one day when all we Americans who are not self-made go back to the old home to eat saleratus biscuits and marvel how much nearer to the porch the old pump looks than it used to. Thanksgiving Day is the one day that is purely American."""
,"""It’s like being at the kids’ table at Thanksgiving – you can put your elbows on it, you don’t have to talk politics… no matter how old I get, there’s always a part of me that’s sitting there."""
,"""Wishing you a Thanksgiving overflowing with peace, love and laughter."""
,"""Thank you for being my greatest blessing."""
